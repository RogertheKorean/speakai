My favorite movie is 3 Idiots, an Indian film that I first watched during my college years. The movie is funny and entertaining, but it also carries a meaningful message about friendship and living with humor and creativity. The story follows three university friends, one of whom is a genius while the others learn from him, but also make silly mistakes and challenge the norms by their professors. What I love about the film is how it encourages thinking outside the box and staying positive despite societal pressures. It inspired me to adopt a more optimistic outlook on life, especially during tough times in university when I struggled with academics. The movie also helped me appreciate the value of friendship and the support my friends friends provided during challenging moments. Three Idiots taught me important life lessons and that's why it remains my favorite movie.
